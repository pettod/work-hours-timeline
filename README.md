# Work Hours Timeline

## 1 Introduction

This script visualizes working hours on timeline. It also calculates the cumulative working hours and shows it as well. Here are some images to show the output.

![Hours per day graph](images/hours_per_day_1.png)

The first graph shows hours done in each marked day.

![Cumulative hours graph](images/cumulative_hours_1.png)

The second graph shows cumulative hours in each marked day.

![Denser timeline](images/denser_timeline.png)

The third graph is the same as first one but shows denser timeline which can be defined by changing the constant variables defined in the beginning of the code.
